## Regular Expressions Excercises

### Make tests pass

Complete the functions on index.py following the intructions given on the comments and make the tests in index_test.py pass.

Note on line 15 on index.py only fill the regexp, do not add any other logic.

For the last excercise, open the file named "terms_and_conditions.txt" and match the pharagraps "Severity","Waiver" and match the ways of contacting the terms and services. Return a dictionary, to see the expected result please look at the test.
